// Introduction and Warm-up (Highly recommended)
// Playing With Lists/Arrays Series
// Task
// Given an array/list [] of integers , Construct a product array Of same size Such That prod[i] is equal to The Product of all the elements of Arr[] except Arr[i].

// Notes
// Array/list size is at least 2 .

// Array/list's numbers Will be only Positives

// Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur.


// Example

// productArray ({10,3,5,6,2}) return ==> {180,600,360,300,900}
// Explanation:
// The first element 180 is the product of all array's elements except the first element 10

// The second element 600 is the product of all array's elements except the second element 3

// The Third element 360 is the product of all array's elements except the third element 5

// The Fourth element 300 is the product of all array's elements except the fourth element 6

// Finally ,The Fifth element 900 is the product of all array's elements except the fifth element 2


function productArray(numbers) {

  let total = numbers.reduce((cur, acc) => cur * acc, 1);
  let proarr = numbers.map(element => total / element);
  return proarr;

}

console.log(productArray([3, 4, 1, 5, 2]))
